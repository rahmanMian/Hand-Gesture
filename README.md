# Complex Hand Gesture Detection
Complex Hand Gesture Detection is a project aimed at utilizing an ESP32-S3 microcontroller and an MPU6050 sensor to capture accelerometer and gyroscope data for interpreting hand gestures. This innovative system has various real-world applications, including controlling smart home devices, enhancing gaming experiences, aiding rehabilitation exercises, improving industrial workflows, and facilitating education and accessibility efforts.

## Motivation

As computer science majors, we were keen on exploring the intersection of hardware and software, diving into the complexities of embedded systems.

## Features
- Hardware Integration: Utilizes an ESP32-S3 microcontroller and an MPU6050 sensor for real-time data capture.
- Machine Learning Pipeline: Implements a machine learning pipeline using a Data Classification Model for interpreting hand gestures.
- Web Application Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface using Python, Flask, and JavaScript submitting data and receiving predictions.
- Continuous Data Collection: Enables live gesture detection by continuously collecting real-time data using serial and PuTTY.
